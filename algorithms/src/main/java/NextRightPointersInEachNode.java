/**
 * Given a binary tree
 *
 * struct TreeLinkNode {
 *   TreeLinkNode *left;
 *   TreeLinkNode *right;
 *   TreeLinkNode *next;
 * }
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node,
 * the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 *
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 * Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
 * You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level,
 * and every parent has two children).
 * Example:
 *
 * Given the following perfect binary tree,
 *
 *      1
 *    /  \
 *   2    3
 *  / \  / \
 * 4  5  6  7
 * After calling your function, the tree should look like:
 *
 *      1 -> NULL
 *    /  \
 *   2 -> 3 -> NULL
 *  / \  / \
 * 4->5->6->7 -> NULL
